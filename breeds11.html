<p><img src="1.jpg" height="200" width="250" align="right" alt="Abaco Barb Horse" hspace="5"/><br/>The Barb is a light riding horse noted for its stamina. It has a powerful front end, high withers, short back, a sloping croup, and carries its tail low. It is hardy with clean legs and sound hooves. It does not have particularly good gaits, but gallops like a sprinter. It was used as breeding stock to develop racing breeds such as the Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse, and Standardbred.

<br/><br/><b>Chracteristices:-</b>The predominant color is gray, but bay, black, chestnut, and brown horses are also found. The Barb stands 1.47–1.57 metres (14.2–15.2 hands) at the withers.
The rare Abaco Barb, which is in great danger of extinction, is believed to have descended from Spanish horses that were in route aboard ships with early explorers to the New World. 
Many of thes ships never reached their destination, and instead were shipwrecked or pirated in the Caribbean. The Abaco Barbs share traits of other Spanish-lineage horses, such as low-set tails, convex faces and thick, long manes and tails. Their ears tend to be pointed, and they have broad foreheads that taper. 
The horses are small, about 13.2 to 14.2 hands, and are exceptionally strong.</p><BR CLEAR="left" />

<br/><b>Chracteristices:-</b>Curly Horses, come in all sizes, colors, and body types but all carry a gene for a unique curly coat of hair.The care for the curly hair is simple with most people choosing to not comb the mane because the hair will lose its curliness. 
The manes are often trimmed to keep them from matting. The tails can be combed. Some people choose to collect the hair that is shed from the mane and tails in the spring. 
The hair is then donated to the ICHO Fiber Guild.
 They use the hair for spinning. All of the proceeds go to ICHO Curly Research Efforts.
